                      <p>From Humble Beginnings to Iconic Advertisements </p>
                      <p>
                        Neon signs have been a staple of advertising for over a
                        century, but where did they come from, and how have they
                        evolved over time? In this article, we'll take a look at
                        the origins of neon signs, how they're made, and how
                        they've been used in advertising throughout history.{" "}

                      <h4 className="blog-title">Origins of Neon Signs </h4>
                      <p>
                        The history of neon signs dates back to the early 1900s,
                        when French engineer Georges Claude invented the first
                        neon lamp in 1902. The lamp consisted of a sealed glass
                        tube filled with neon gas and an electrode at each end.
                        When a high voltage was applied to the electrodes, the
                        gas inside the tube glowed brightly, creating a
                        distinctive and eye-catching light.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Claude's invention quickly caught on, and neon signs
                        began appearing in Paris and other major cities across
                        Europe. In 1923, neon signs made their way to the United
                        States, where they quickly became a popular form of
                        advertising.{" "}

                      <p>
                        Today, there are several types of neon lights, each with
                        its own unique properties and applications.{" "}

                          <p>
                            These signs are made using glass tubes filled with
                            neon gas, which glows brightly when a current is
                            applied. Traditional neon signs are often used for
                            outdoor advertising and storefront displays.

                            Cold cathode tubes are similar to traditional neon
                            signs, but they're made using a different type of
                            gas and a higher voltage. They're often used for
                            indoor lighting and decorative purposes.

                            LED neon signs use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to
                            create a neon-like glow. They're more
                            energy-efficient and durable than traditional neon
                            signs, and they're often used for indoor signage and
